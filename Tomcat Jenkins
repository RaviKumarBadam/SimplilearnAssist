Tomcat 9.x is already installed on the lab system
  
 To verify:
 sudo /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
 On web browser open localhost:8082 (this is the port on which it is configured)
 
 We need to create a user in tomcat-users.xml
 sudo vi /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
 
 Towards the bottom of the file add this line 
 <user username="robot" password="deploy" roles="manager-script" />
 
 We will be using a maven Java example. 
  - In pom.xml, be sure to change packaging to war (from jar)
  
 On Jenkins->Manage Jenkins-> Manage plugins-> Install "Deploy to container plugin"
  
 On Jenkins-> New Maven build job:
  -Source code: git (https://github.com/nagenn/maven-app)
  -Build trigger: Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built
  - Build - Root POM - default value (pom.xml)
  - goals: clean install
  - post build step:  Deploy war/ear to a container
  WAR/EAR files: **/*.war
  Containers: Tomcat 9.x
  Add Jenkins credential:
  Global
  User name/password
  User name: robot
  password: deploy
  ID: Tomcat-Jenkins (give it some sensible name)
  Save
  Back in the Post-build action: choose the credential you just created
  Save.
  
  Build
  
  Confirm in the /opt/tomcat/webapps folder, your .war file has been built
  
  on a web browser: localhost:<yourport>/<yourwarname>
